Gameplay demos and testing for an upcoming game. No real graphics, but who needs them when a game is fun?


For those people who have little to no coding experience and who want to test out the game in these files, follow these instructions.
1: Download a program that can open the files. I recommend the free community version of Microsoft Visual Studio, 
    and these instructions will be made assuming you are using that program.
2: Save all the files into a single folder. Where that folder is and what it is named don't matter, so long as you can find it easily.
3: Open Visual Studio and go to [File > New > Project from existing code]. Select the folder you saved the files, and the program will do the rest.
4: Click the green arrow at the top of the screen that says "Local Windows Debugger" or just press F5. Press "yes" when the project asks you to build, and it will start the game!


For updating files in the future, simply replace the old versions from that folder with the new ones.
